## Graph Property Prediction Experiment
We consider the prediction of three graph properties - Diameter, Single-Source Shortest Paths (SSSP), and node Eccentricity on synthetic graphs following the setup outlined in [_Gravina et al. Anti-Symmetric DGN: a stable architecture for Deep Graph Networks. ICLR 2023_](https://github.com/gravins/Anti-SymmetricDGN/tree/main/graph_prop_pred).

This code is adapted from the [SWAN repository](https://github.com/gravins/SWAN/tree/main/graph_property_prediction).

To reproduce our experiments please consider running the script ``` run.sh ```.
