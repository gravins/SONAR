## LRGB and Heterophilic experiments

Our evaluation spans several benchmark suites: the Peptides-func, Peptides-struct, and Pascal VOC-SP datasets from LRGB, alongside a suite of heterophilic tasks including Roman-empire, Amazon-ratings, Minesweeper, Tolokers, and Questions.

The code is adapted from [CoGNN repository](https://github.com/benfinkelshtein/CoGNN).

To reproduce our experiments please consider running the script ```run.py```.
